Robot Masters
=============

Core Ideas

1. Players are normal humans. Gameplay shifts between characters and controller
2. Focus on loot/items for building robots.
3. Divers/megaman legends

Stats
-----
Focus - Ability to quiet the mind and zero in your machine. Skill prized by Vanguards as it helps them target their enemies.
  Combat, Attacking, Targeting, Enduring

Acuity - A pilot's mental agility. Allows them to optimize multiple systems at once.
  Movement, Dodging, Escaping

Intellect - General smarts.

Weird - Ability to think outside the box. Allows them to control fields and special devices.

Stats can be any number from -2 to 5. Stats give mod points.

Dice Pools
----------
A pool size is generally determined by items. Acuity rolls however start at 1/2 a robots movement rounded down. So a movement of 5 gives 2 dice.


Basic Frame
-----------
4 Movement

2 Hand Slots
1 Armor Slot
1 Head Slot
1 Chest Slot
1 Leg Slot
1 Back Slot
1 Internal Slot

1 Operator Power

Every Robot has an escape item.

Each slot can normally have only a single modifier.


Heros
-----
Navigator - Typically uses support Frames with buff/cc abilities
Engineer - Typically uses healer frames
Vanguard - Typically uses combat frames
  Trusty Weapon - At the beginning of each dive select one item with an attack action. When using that item to attack reroll 1s.
  Energized Assault - After any attack you may move Power to unallocated. For each power after the first that attack deals 1 extra damage divided as you chose among all targets.

Line of Site Rules
------

To determine the LOS for an actor pick ANY corner of the actors square.

If an unobstructed imaginary line can be drawn from that corner to ALL corners of the target's square they have no cover.

If instead an unobstructed imaginary line can be drawn from that corner to any part of the target's square they have partial cover.

If no unobstructed lines can be drawn they have total cover.

Effects of Cover
------
Total - The attack cannot be completed.
Partial - After all other effects before any damage is done reroll 5s.

Actions
-------
Re-allocate - By default move a single shield charge around. Reallocation does form a special type of healing, so probably shouldn't go above 3. Or instead of increasing the amount a 'capacitor' item can be charged that can be used all at once.
Standard - allow ready
Move - allow break
Bonus - 1/turn
Reaction
Free

Move Actions
------------
Normal Move - Move up to your move.
Slide - Move 1. Does not provoke.

Reactions
---------
Op Attack - When Provoked perform a melee attack.

Health
------

There are three types of Health. Shield, Armor, and Reactor. Damage is normally applied in that order as well.

Shield - Energy based armor. Normally has DR 0 and can regenerate.
Armor - Physical armor. Does not regenerate, normally has DR. e.g. a hit must be of a certain power to dent the armor.
Reactor - A robots reactor generates, so much power it actually generates its own special shielding. Each damage to the reactor moves a charge from any card to unallocted. Reactor

A robot's frame should always require 1 power. If at any point that frame is not powered the robot will explode.

Capacitance X
---

A modifier items can have. Items with Capacitance can store power up to X. That power can be moved to another item during the allocation phase for free. Power can not be split up from one item with Capacitance.
